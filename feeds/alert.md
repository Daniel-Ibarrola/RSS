## About CAP 


### Updating alerts

Whenever a CAP alert is changed, a new Alert (a new XML file) is issued. When this occurs, a new 
Atom feed <entry> or RSS feed <item> should be created that links to the new alert. A feed should 
not edit information in an already-issued CAP alert. This practice helps ensure that thereâ€™s a 
trailing record of changes to an alert.
